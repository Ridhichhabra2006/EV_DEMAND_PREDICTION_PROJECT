## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **preparing and analyzing EV adoption data** as part of the **AICTE Internship (July 2025)**. The goal is to clean, transform, and visualize the dataset to support accurate **forecasting of electric vehicle growth** across U.S. counties and states.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Handle missing and inconsistent values  
- ✅ Detect and treat outliers using the IQR method  
- ✅ Engineer new features from date columns  
- ✅ Visualize EV adoption trends over time  
- ✅ Prepare data for machine learning and forecasting models

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

- **Date** – The timestamp of data collection  
- **State / County** – Geographic distribution of adoption  
- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Total** – Total number of EVs  
- **Percent Electric Vehicles** – EVs as a percentage of total vehicles

## 📁 Folder Structure

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- `Python `
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

---

## 🌟 What's Next?

- Build a **forecasting model** (Prophet / ARIMA / ML)
- Analyze EV adoption by state over time
- Deploy the forecasting model in a dashboard (Streamlit / Flask)
